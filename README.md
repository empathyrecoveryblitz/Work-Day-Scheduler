## Description 

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The starter code uses the Moment.js library to work with date and time, but feel free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality since Moment.js is considered a "legacy" project. Learn more about some alternative solutions in the Moment.js project status page.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## Usage 

Click on the text area of the timeblock you want to alter and type in your task. Click the save icon and everything you typed will be saved in local storage for later use.
